# Blood-Bank-System
This is a Blood Bank Management System, a desktop application developed as a DBMS project using Java Swing for the frontend and MySQL for the backend, connected seamlessly through JDBC connectivity.

The application's primary functionality revolves around user interaction, catering to both donors and purchasers. New users, whether donors or purchasers, are required to register within the system. Once registered, users can log in to the application to initiate blood donation or purchase transactions.

One of the key features of the system is its ability to maintain a comprehensive database of donors and purchasers. Users can view detailed profiles of individuals who have donated or bought blood, including contact information such as phone numbers and their respective blood groups. This feature facilitates efficient communication and tracking of blood donors and purchasers within the system.

The application provides users with an overview of available blood packets categorized by blood groups. This functionality allows users to quickly identify the availability of specific blood types, aiding in prompt and accurate blood allocation when needed. Additionally, users can search for donors based on specific blood groups, enabling targeted outreach for blood donation requests.

Another crucial aspect of the system is its ability to track donor and purchaser history. Users can access historical data regarding their own donation or purchase activities, providing transparency and accountability in blood bank transactions. This feature also enables administrators to analyze trends and patterns in blood donation and purchase activities over time.
